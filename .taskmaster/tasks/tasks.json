Configured currency display for Bangladeshi Taka (৳) with proper formatting and set date formats to DD/MM/YYYY according to local conventions. Developed a LanguageSwitcher component enabling users to toggle between English and Bengali languages, integrated into the home screen for testing. The implementation ensures users can switch languages seamlessly and experience the app interface fully localized in Bengali, including correct right-to-left (RTL) text direction support and culturally appropriate formatting.\n</info added on 2025-06-30T06:05:03.173Z>",
